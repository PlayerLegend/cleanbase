The intention of this mod is to provide a clean base (no warnings, simple codebase) for making further modifications
Included will be:
	 Player movement
	 Player/Monster/Other animation using mdls
	 Essential map funcs and triggers
	 Linked lists using entities

This should be engine portable, but not necessarily compiler portable, I will use fteqcc
Later I will fork this and add skeletal animation support and whatever other FTE bells & whistles come up
