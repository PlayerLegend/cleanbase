Might try working on a way to do modular weapons without arrays
fix doors to work with trigger locks, like on E3M1

.touch activates the train's .e_target, this includes the set origin

###
add double move functionality to doors
#
buttons, doors, secret doors, triggers, and plats work now
activations are run twice on everything, check why
trains do not work
moving things always kill if blocked
make sure everything is turned on when spawned, a check for this has been added
get trigger_hurt working



Darkplaces bug with string offset is somewhere in the spawning of a trigger for triggerless doors and plats

IMPORTANT NOTE - Add to docs:
	  find does not return world if passed the string "" in engines other than FTE
	  CRC appears when necessary things are missing from the first file(ie: defs.qc)




Implement killtarget

Players still have a chance to fall out of world when joining the server

make monsters work with triggers
